### üó£Ô∏è About

> _[Code Challenge is] a contest that consists of some typical programming challenges, and other challenges that don‚Äôt include any hints and can be quite tricky._

It was formerly known as the Tuenti Challenge and more info about the past editions can be found [**here**](https://codechallenge.0x14.net/Info/past) (requires login).

### ü§î My approach

After a few minutes of staring at a .c file, I decided this challenge was a good opportunity to learn something new and that I'd do it using **Python**. I took a Python course a long time ago, but after 7 years I had to Google even the most basic things. Even then, I had a lot of fun re/learning the language and discovering how powerful and convenient it is!

### üòé My results

I started the challenge a day late and was the ~300th person to submit the first problem correctly, so I didn't think I'd make it into the top 100. However after a lot of code, sweat and tears I climbed a few positions and ended the challenge at 66th. Then after wrong solutions were reviewed (and mine were all good, yay) I got to the **61st position**!

A lot of the problems were really challenging and included concepts I knew nothing about, so being able to do half of them in limited time was great and I'm very happy with how they turned out! 

### ‚úåÔ∏è Key concepts

These are some of the key concepts that I needed, used or learned to solve each of the challenges. You can find more information about them on their respective pages.

[Challenge 1 - Roll the dice!](/01%20RollDice)
* Reading from an input file using open() and .readlines()
* Writing output to an output file using .write()
* Basic usage of loops, conditionals, variables and data types
* Using range() and enumerate()

[Challenge 2 - Catch them all](/02%20CatchEmAll)
* Basic string manipulation (combine, replace characters, reverse, search)
* Basic list manipulation (append, pop)
* String searching

[Challenge 3 - The night of the hunter](03%20NightHunter)
* Data parsing in three different formats (using partition and split)
* Comparing fractions without using floats
* Using map(), filter() and zip()
* Using dictionaries and the dict() function
* Using def to make functions
* Importing a module

[Challenge 4 - Let‚Äôs build musical scales](/04%20MusicScales)
* Careful data manipulation and list iteration (e.g. using [1:] or [::2])
* Filling up a list with elements from another with very specific conditions

[Challenge 5 - Invictus](/05%20Invictus)
* Basic CTF
* Scanning a file and detecting non-ascii characters
* Using a target string to decode the pattern looking for differences between its characters

[Challenge 6 - What day is it?](/06%20Day)
* Looking up the days of the week in 20 languages with special characters (why)
* Making sure said days had the correct characters (this was painful and took a lot of trial and error and copying and pasting)
* Calculating dates correctly for normal and leap years

[Challenge 7 - Escape or Die](/07%20Escape)
* Working with a subprocess, reading its input and outputting commands to it
* Using netcat to connect to a host
* Transversing a maze and listing all possible solutions (paths to an exit) to get the shortest one

[Challenge 8 - Awesome Sales Inc.!](/08%20CityBuses)
* Checking if a graph is connected or not
* Complexity (or why having six nested loops working with giant matrices andd being extremely redundant is not a good idea)
* Using DFS (depth first search) and recursive backtracking 

[Challenge 9 - Collisions](/09%20Collisions)
* Detecting if two (large) sprites in an (even larger) map collide
* Calculating all collisions between sprites in a somewhat reasonable time

[Challenge 10 - Packets delivery](/10%20Packets)
* Using tcpdump to read the contents of a pcap file
* Sorting the contentes of a pcap file by sequence number
* Finding hexadecimal PNG data and writing the appropriate bytes to a PNG file

If you look at my code please note that for the most part, I had no idea what I was doing and a lot of it will be ugly and full of commented-out stuff. It may be hard to read, but time constraints and the fact that I was using a new language didn't let me get too fancy. In any case, thanks for reading!
